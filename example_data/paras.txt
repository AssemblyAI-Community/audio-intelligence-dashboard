You will never believe what happened to me last week. My SUV broke down, so I had to send it to an auto shop to get a new gasket installed. Yesterday I was walking in South Boston to pick the car up and some guy got thrown through the window of a pub right in front of me. A few guys had been drinking and they got into an argument about the Red Sox, which resulted in a fight. When I went to break up the fight, one of the guys accidentally hit me with his elbow in the face, so I fell back and ##### ## #####.

I went to the emergency room and had to get surgery, which sucks because I have to wear a cast for two weeks and it cost me almost $#,###. My wrist still feels like s***, and I've had to take ##### all week. Besides that, things are pretty good. I started my master's degree in Political Science, which I'm excited about. The school has a great program, and I've already met a lot of good professors.

After the program, I'm going to go to law school, so it will help prepare me for that. The other good news is that I get to keep playing basketball while I'm in school. Usually people stop playing after undergrad, but I get to keep playing while I earn my degree, which is great. The program has a ton of good nutrition and physical therapy resources, too. I'm really excited to start playing on my new team.

As for this weekend, I don't have much going on. I have to call the phone company to see if I can get a new phone. The battery on my phone is broken, so I want to get it replaced. What are you doing this weekend?
